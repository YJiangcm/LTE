We introduces a novel Learning to Edit (**LTE**) framework for effective and efficient knowledge editing of large language models (LLMs).
our LTE framework focuses on teaching LLMs to **apply** updated knowledge into input questions, inspired by the philosophy of "_Teach a man to fish_."

As the below figure shows, LTE features a two-phase process: (i) the **Alignment Phase**, which fine-tunes LLMs on a meticulously curated parallel dataset to make reliable, in-scope edits while preserving out-of-scope information and linguistic proficiency; and (ii) the **Inference Phase**, which employs a retrieval-based mechanism for real-time and mass knowledge editing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to implement

### Requirements
**Note: Please use Python 3.10+ for LTE.**  To get started, simply install conda and run:
```
conda create -n LTE python=3.10
conda activate LTE
conda install pytorch==2.1.1 torchvision==0.16.1 torchaudio==2.1.1 pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 1. Alignment Phrase
Firstly, please download the training data of LTE from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/YuxinJiang/LTE_train_data) and put it into [data/](data/).

#### LLaMA2-Chat-7B
The code is based on [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat). Standard fine-tuning was conducted on 4√óA100 GPUs (80G) for about 9 hours.
```bash
cd LTE/
bash FastChat/ft_train.sh
```

To reduce the total memory footprint, LTE also supports [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685), which fine-tunes low-rank slices of the query, key, and value embedding heads.
```bash
cd LTE/
bash FastChat/lora_train.sh
```

#### Qwen-Chat-7B
The code is based on [Qwen](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen). Standard fine-tuning was conducted on 4√óA100 GPUs (80G) for about 9 hours.
```bash
cd LTE/
bash Qwen/finetune/finetune_ds.sh
```

To reduce the total memory footprint, LTE also supports [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685), which fine-tunes low-rank slices of the query, key, and value embedding heads.
```bash
cd LTE/
bash Qwen/finetune/finetune_lora_single_gpu.sh
```

### 2. Inference Phrase
The evaluation of our proposed LTE is based on [EasyEdit](https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit). Please download [multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1) and add it to "LTE/SeqEdit/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1".

Please run the following command for experiments of **LLaMA2-Chat-7B**:
```bash
cd LTE/
bash EasyEdit/run_lte_llama.sh
bash SeqEdit/run_lte_llama.sh
```

Please run the following command for experiments of **Qwen-Chat-7B**:
```bash
cd LTE/
bash EasyEdit/run_lte_qwen.sh
bash SeqEdit/run_lte_qwen.sh
```
